roa: Ruby-based OpenMRS API
===========================

## Description
--------------
roa is a Ruby-based API for OpenMRS data model. OpenMRS is a community-developed, open-source, enterprise electronic medical record system framework. (http://openmrs.org/wiki/OpenMRS). OpenMRS is a generic medical record system that can support the care of patients, gathering observations, encounters, notes, and other data from the healthcare system and rendering those in summaries, reports, and data views that would improve the effectiveness of the people using the system. However, OpenMRS is a Java-based. roa is a Ruby implementation for OpenMRS.

roa started as a free style coding project. The idea came as a way of standardizing [Baobab Health](http://baobabhealth.org/)'s Ruby OpenMRS API.
